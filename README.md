## Overview of the statistical analysis:
I’m tasked with analyzing temperature trends in June and December in Oahu in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results:
Three key differences in weather between June and December:
- June temperatures are higher than December.
- The minimum temperature values show the greatest difference. 
- There’s more data for June vs. December.
