## Overview of the statistical analysis:
I’m tasked with analyzing temperature trends in June and December in Oahu in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results:
Three key differences in weather between June and December:
- June temperatures are higher than December.
- The minimum temperature values show the greatest difference. 
- There’s more data for June vs. December.

## Summary
June and December temperatures on average are within 4 degrees showing that temperatures are consistent throughout the year. Oahu would make a fantastic sight to setup a year-round Ice Cream shop. This review should be repeated for all the months with the year. We could also include historical data from the last 5 years. It may also be a good idea to google any extreme weather events such as flooding & typhoons and talk to locals to get more insight into Oahu.
